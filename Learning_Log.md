# Learning Log
## Week 1
### Learning Figma
The first learning curve for me was the introduction to Figma. I have used other mind-mapping software before, so I felt somewhat confident. Before I started, I created a personal Figma account so I could explore its resources. I noticed the default files in a project are the Concept Map, Flowchart and Wireframe. The team decided we should focus on the Concept Map. After watching a short introduction on YouTube, then following Figma's own tutorial and testing things out on my own account, I felt ready to contribute.

### Contribution to the Concept Map
Firstly, I decided to contribute to the decomposition map. On the back end of the pint pricing side of the website, I noticed the idea to store all required information in JSON files. While I agree with this, editing what is stored in those files, like prices of pints, may be difficult. Thus, I added an extra node describing an easy way to edit these details for developers.

### Contribution to the Ideas Board
The ideas board was already filled with good ideas involving front and back end design. However, I noticed missing features involving bar crawl routes. I thought a good idea was to be able to save favourite bar crawl routes to a favourites page, assuming we will use accounts for individual users. Or, similarly, a user could export a bar crawl route as text, or a picture.

## Week 2
### Getting my head round the tech stack
The next new concepts for me consisted of React itself, Next.js and TailwindCSS. Going into this project, I only had a very rough idea of what React is, and I'd never heard of Next.js or TailwindCSS. The first way I chose to introduce myself was a ten minute Youtube tutorial and explanation on what React is, before using generative AI models to teach myself what TailwindCSS and Next.js are.

### Creating react_test with Next.js
Realising Next.js and React are npm modules made sense for me. I created a Next.js project using their automatic installation I found in their docs, where I then answered questions for the set up. Running the Next developer mode was very convenient, which reminded me of nodemon.

### Creating a React element
After learning what an element is in React, I created a test div, which contained a header, paragraph and button.

### Using TailwindCSS
Using the docs, I was able to use TailwindCSS to add some custome styles to the element, including centering the div, adding text colours and fonts and hover transitions for the button.

### Finishing the full test project
I finished off the test project by adding some dynamic functionality to the button by using React's 'useState'. When the button is clicked, the text changes on the button. Also, I learnt about the ability TailwindCSS has to change formatting depending on the screen size, which I used to reduce the font size of the header and paragraph when the screen size is small.

## Week 2
### Cleaning up the Git repo
After my first git clone, I realised node_modules for the frontend and backend was stored on the repo.
