# Learning Log
## Week 1
### Learning Figma
The first learning curve for me was the introduction to Figma. I have used other mind-mapping software before, so I felt somewhat confident. Before I started, I created a personal Figma account so I could explore its resources. I noticed the default files in a project are the Concept Map, Flowchart and Wireframe. The team decided we should focus on the Concept Map. After watching a short introduction on YouTube, then following Figma's own tutorial and testing things out on my own account, I felt ready to contribute.

### Contribution to the Concept Map
Firstly, I decided to contribute to the decomposition map. On the back end of the pint pricing side of the website, I noticed the idea to store all required information in JSON files. While I agree with this, editing what is stored in those files, like prices of pints, may be difficult. Thus, I added an extra node describing an easy way to edit these details for developers.

### Contribution to the Ideas Board
The ideas board was already filled with good ideas involving front and back end design. However, I noticed missing features involving bar crawl routes. I thought a good idea was to be able to save favourite bar crawl routes to a favourites page, assuming we will use accounts for individual users. Or, similarly, a user could export a bar crawl route as text, or a picture.
